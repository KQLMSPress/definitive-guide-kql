## How to Use the KQL Materialize Function

#### KQL queries from the How to Use the KQL Materialize Function section of chapter 3 are found below

#### Use the copy option (to the right of each code box) to copy the query to paste into your own environment

#### Some queries use example data, or are based on hyopthetical scenarios, and you should switch in relevant data to your environment if required


##### Materialize function syntax
```KQL
materialize(expression)
```

##### Speeding up Queries with Heavy Calculations
```KQL
let _detailed_data = materialize(StormEvents | summarize Events=count() by State, EventType);
_detailed_data
| summarize TotalStateEvents=sum(Events) by State
| join (_detailed_data) on State
| extend EventPercentage = Events*100.0 / TotalStateEvents
| project State, EventType, EventPercentage, Events
| top 10 by EventPercentage
```

##### Efficient Evaluation of Non-Deterministic Expressions
```KQL
let randomSet = materialize(range x from 1 to 3000000 step 1 | project value = rand(10000000));
randomSet
| summarize Dcount=dcount(value)
; randomSet
| top 3 by value
; randomSet
| summarize Sum=sum(value)
```

##### Using Materialize() in Let Statements
```KQL
let materializedData = materialize(AppAvailabilityResults | where TimeGenerated > ago(1d));
union (materializedData | where AppRoleName !has "somestring" | summarize dcount(ClientOS)),
      (materializedData | where AppRoleName !has "somestring" | summarize dcount(ClientCity)) 
```
