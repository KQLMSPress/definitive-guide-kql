## Using the bin() KQL Function

#### KQL queries from the Using the bin() KQL Function in KQL section of chapter 3 are found below

#### Use the copy option (to the right of each code box) to copy the query to paste into your own environment

#### Some queries use example data, or are based on hyopthetical scenarios, and you should switch in relevant data to your environment if required


##### Numeric Binning with the bin() Function
```KQL
datatable(Date: datetime, Revenue: real)
[
    datetime(2023-01-01), 1200.50,
    datetime(2023-01-02), 2500.75,
    datetime(2023-01-03), 1800.25,
    datetime(2023-01-04), 3100.80,
    datetime(2023-01-05), 900.10
]
| summarize TotalRevenue = sum(Revenue) by bin(Revenue, 1000)
```

##### Timespan Binning with the bin() Function
```KQL
datatable(CallDuration: timespan)
[
    time(0h, 2m, 30s),
    time(0h, 7m, 45s),
    time(0h, 4m, 20s),
    time(0h, 10m, 15s),
    time(0h, 1m, 30s)
]
| summarize Count = count() by bin(CallDuration, 5m) 
```

##### Datetime Binning with the bin() Function
```KQL
datatable(OrderTime: datetime)
[
    datetime(2023-01-01 10:00:00),
    datetime(2023-01-01 14:30:00),
    datetime(2023-01-02 11:45:00),
    datetime(2023-01-02 13:15:00),
    datetime(2023-01-03 09:20:00)
]
| summarize Count = count() by bin(OrderTime, 1d)
```

##### Pad a Table with Null Bins
```KQL
datatable(Date: datetime, Visits: int)
[
    datetime(2023-01-01), 500,
    datetime(2023-01-03), 800,
    datetime(2023-01-04), 600,
    datetime(2023-01-06), 1200,
    datetime(2023-01-07), 900
]
| summarize Visits = sum(Visits) by bin(Date, 1d)
| range d from datetime(2023-01-01) to datetime(2023-01-07) step 1d
| join kind=leftouter (datatable(Date: datetime) [d]) on Date
| order by Date asc 
```
