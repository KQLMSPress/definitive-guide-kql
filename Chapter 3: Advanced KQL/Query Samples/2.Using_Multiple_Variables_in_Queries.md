## Using Multiple Variables in Queries

#### KQL queries from the Using Multiple Variables in Queries section of chapter 3 are found below

#### Use the copy option (to the right of each code box) to copy the query to paste into your own environment

#### Some queries use example data, or are based on hyopthetical scenarios, and you should switch in relevant data to your environment if required


##### Filtering data using multiple variables
```KQL
let country = "United States";
let city = "Washington";
AppAvailabilityResults
| where ClientCountryOrRegion == country and ClientCity == city
```

##### Using default values in a function
```KQL
let timeDiffInDays = (startDate: datetime, endDate: datetime = now()) {
    toscalar(endDate - startDate) / 1d
};
MyTable
| extend ElapsedDays = timeDiffInDays(StartTime, now())
```

##### Creating a view based on a query
```KQL
let AsiaRegion = view () {
    AppAvailabilityResults
    | where ClientCountryOrRegion == "Asia"
};
AsiaRegion
| project Name, OperationName 
```

##### Caching subquery results for performance
```KQL
let totalEventsPerDay = AppAvailabilityResults
| summarize TotalEvents = count() by Day = startofday(TimeGenerated);
let cachedResult = materialize(totalEventsPerDay);
cachedResult
| project Day, Percentage = TotalEvents / toscalar(cachedResult | summarize sum(TotalEvents))
```
