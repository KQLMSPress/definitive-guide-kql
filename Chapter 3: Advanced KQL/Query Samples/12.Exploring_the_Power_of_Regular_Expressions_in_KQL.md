## Exploring the Power of Regular Expressions in KQL

#### KQL queries from the Exploring the Power of Regular Expressions in KQL section of chapter 3 are found below

#### Use the copy option (to the right of each code box) to copy the query to paste into your own environment

#### Some queries use example data, or are based on hyopthetical scenarios, and you should switch in relevant data to your environment if required


##### Test a regex pattern in KQL
```KQL
let Regex=@"(?i)attrib.*\+h\\";
let TestString="attribute  +h\";
print(iif(TestString matches regex Regex, true,false));  
```
