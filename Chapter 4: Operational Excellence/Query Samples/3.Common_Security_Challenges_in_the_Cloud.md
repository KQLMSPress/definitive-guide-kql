## Common Security Challenges in the Cloud

#### KQL queries from the Common Security Challenges in the Cloud section of chapter 4 are found below

#### Use the copy option (to the right of each code box) to copy the query to paste into your own environment

#### Some queries use example data, or are based on hyopthetical scenarios, and you should switch in relevant data to your environment if required

##### Performance troubleshooting. There are several queries you can use to look at your SQL server performance. The first query is looking for deadlock on the system that could lead to poor performance. The second query looks at the average CPU usage in the last hour. Consistently high averages could indicate a need to add additional resources.
```KQL
AzureMetrics 
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.SQL" 
| where TimeGenerated >=ago(60min) 
| where MetricName in ('deadlock') 
| parse _ResourceId with * "/microsoft.sql/servers/" Resource // subtract Resource name for _ResourceId 
| summarize Deadlock_max_60Mins = max(Maximum) by Resource, MetricName
```

```KQL
AzureMetrics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.SQL" // /DATABASES
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(60min)
| where MetricName in ('cpu_percent') 
| parse _ResourceId with * "/microsoft.sql/servers/" Resource  // subtract Resource name for _ResourceId
| summarize CPU_Maximum_last15mins = max(Maximum), CPU_Minimum_last15mins = min(Minimum), CPU_Average_last15mins = avg(Average) by Resource , MetricName
```

##### Token protection in conditional access deployment, to minimize the likelihood of user disruption due to applications or device incompatibility, we highly recommend doing staged deployment and actively monitoring the sign-in logs. This query gives an administrator a per users view of token protection conditional access rules impact. 
```KQL
//Per users query  
// Select the log you want to query (SigninLogs or AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs )  
//SigninLogs  
AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs  
// Adjust the time range below  
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)  
| project Id,ConditionalAccessPolicies, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, ResourceDisplayName  
| where ConditionalAccessPolicies != "[]" 
| where ResourceDisplayName == "Office 365 Exchange Online" or ResourceDisplayName =="Office 365 SharePoint Online"  
//Add userPrincipalName if you want to filter   
// | where UserPrincipalName =="<user_principal_Name>"  
| mv-expand todynamic(ConditionalAccessPolicies) 
| where ConditionalAccessPolicies ["enforcedSessionControls"] contains '["Binding"]' or ConditionalAccessPolicies ["enforcedSessionControls"] contains '["SignInTokenProtection"]' 
| where ConditionalAccessPolicies.result !="reportOnlyNotApplied" and ConditionalAccessPolicies.result !="notApplied"  
| extend SessionNotSatisfyResult = ConditionalAccessPolicies.sessionControlsNotSatisfied  
| extend Result = case (SessionNotSatisfyResult contains 'SignInTokenProtection' or SessionNotSatisfyResult contains 'SignInTokenProtection', 'Block','Allow') 
| summarize by Id, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, ResourceDisplayName,Result   
| summarize Requests = count(),Block = countif(Result == "Block"), Allow = countif(Result == "Allow") by UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName,ResourceDisplayName  
| extend PctAllowed = round(100.0 * Allow/(Allow+Block), 2)  
| sort by UserPrincipalName asc
