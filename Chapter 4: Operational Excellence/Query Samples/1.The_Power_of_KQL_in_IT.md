## The Power of KQL in IT

#### KQL queries from the Power of KQL in IT Examples section of chapter 4 are found below

#### Use the copy option (to the right of each code box) to copy the query to paste into your own environment

#### Some queries use example data, or are based on hyopthetical scenarios, and you should switch in relevant data to your environment if required

##### This query helps you find short lived connections in your database. Sample Output: A time-chart showing the trends long vs short lived connection over time. If your application is designed around short-lived connections and you expect many queries from different client sessions, then it may benefit from using connection pooling.
