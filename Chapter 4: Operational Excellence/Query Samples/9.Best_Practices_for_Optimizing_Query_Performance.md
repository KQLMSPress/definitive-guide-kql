## Best Practices for Optimizing Query Performance

#### KQL queries from the Best Practices for Optimizing Query Performance section of chapter 4 are found below

#### Use the copy option (to the right of each code box) to copy the query to paste into your own environment

#### Some queries use example data, or are based on hyopthetical scenarios, and you should switch in relevant data to your environment if required


##### Efficient Extraction of Fields from Dynamic Objects
```KQL
// Define a variable that holds a tabular expression
let _data = materialize(
    StormEvents
    | where StartTime > ago(1d)
    | summarize count() by State, EventType
);

// Use the variable multiple times in the query
_data
| summarize TotalEvents = sum(count_) by State
| join kind=inner (_data) on State
| extend EventPercentage = count_*100.0 / TotalEvents
| project State, EventType, EventPercentage, count_
| order by State asc, EventPercentage desc
```

##### Using Materialized Views for Commonly Used Aggregations
```KQL
let MyDataSource = materialize(MyTable | where Timestamp > ago(1d));
MyDataSource
| where EventType == 'Error'
| summarize Count = count() by Bin = bin(Timestamp, 1h)
| render timechart
```
