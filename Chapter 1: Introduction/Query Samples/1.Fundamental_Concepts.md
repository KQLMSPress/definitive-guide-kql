## Fundamental Concepts

#### KQL queries from the Fundamental Concepts section of chapter 1 are found below

#### Use the copy option (to the right of each code box) to copy the query to paste into your own environment

#### Some queries use example data, or are based on hyopthetical scenarios, and you should switch in relevant data to your environment if required


##### Example KQL query and first query to run
```KQL
SigninLogs //the table
| where TimeGenerated > ago (1h) //filtering by time range
| summarize count() by ConditionalAccessStatus //What is the total count
| order by ConditionalAccessStatus asc //Sort ascending, largest first
| project ConditionalAccessStatus, Total = count_ //Output of the columns
```

##### Looking for failed KeyVault operations. The query below helps monitor for failed operations in the last 24 hours. Frequent failures can indicate an adversary trying to gain unauthorized access. These should be investigated.

```KQL
AzureDiagnostics
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.KEYVAULT"
| where ResultType != "Success"
```

##### Using the getschema operator
```KQL
SigninLogs
| getschema
```
